At the annual celebration of mrange, a 35-year-old mvictim carries a placard that reads, "Thank you, mthing, for my happy childhood!"

mman berates him: "What’s that? Are you mocking mthing? mthing isn’t a thing yet when you were a child!"

"That’s precisely why I’m grateful to it!"
--- 
mman says, "We are going to do two things starting from next week. First, we will fully implement mthing; second, all mvictim need to claim a lizard from the office on Saturday. Any opinions?"

After a short while, someone in the audience asks, "Why do we need to claim a lizard?"

"Good, I knew you all wouldn’t have any objections regarding mthing."
---
"mthing is so fucking moron!"

"You dare to insult mman?! come with me."

"I didn't say which mthing!"

"Don’t try to trick me! You think I wouldn’t know which mthing is moron?"

At a meeting of mvictim, mman makes a speech.

"Soon we will achieve the goal of mtheory!"

"Is mthing an art or a science?"

"I can’t say for sure, but definitely not a science."

"Why?"

"If mthing is a science, they should have experimented with mice first, not us."

At a meeting, the host says, "If you support mthing, please sit on the left. Otherwise, sit on the right."

Most people proceed to sit on the left, a few proceed to sit on the right, but only one person remains seated.

The host is puzzled and asks why.

The person says, "I understand the concerns of mvictim, but I support mthing."

"Please come take a seat on the rostrum." The host says in a hurried tone.

Soon minutes of the "Care for mvictim, support mthing” conference will be filling library shelves at rate exceeding the speed of light. There is no violation of special relativity, however, as no information is being propagated.

mman says, "We will sacrifice anything to let the owners of mrange achieve the goal of mtheory!"

The other mvictim says, "No, we are the 'anything'."
